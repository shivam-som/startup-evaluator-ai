## LangGraph Workflow Diagram

Below is a simplified representation of how the multi-agent workflow operates:

    +------------------+
    |  User Input Idea  |
    +---------+--------+
              |
              v
    +------------------+
    |  Market Analyst  |
    +---------+--------+
              |
      (if market viable)
              v
    +------------------+
    | Technical Reviewer|
    +---------+--------+
              |
      (if technically feasible)
              v
    +------------------+
    | Business Strategist|
    +---------+--------+
              |
              v
    +------------------+
    | Recommendation    |
    | & Final Report    |
    +---------+--------+
              |
              v
    +------------------+
    | Streamed Output  |
    +------------------+


**Notes:**  
- **Conditional branching:** Agents can skip or escalate based on prior results (e.g., non-viable ideas).  
- **Context sharing:** Each agent builds upon outputs from previous agents.  
- **Streaming:** The final evaluation is streamed incrementally to the frontend.
